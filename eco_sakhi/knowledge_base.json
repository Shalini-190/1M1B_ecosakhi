            "question": "What is renewable energy?",
            "answer": "üå± Renewable energy is energy derived from natural sources that are replenished on a human timescale. Unlike fossil fuels such as coal, oil, and gas, which are finite, renewable sources are virtually inexhaustible.\n\nHere are the main types:\n- <b>Solar Energy (üåû):</b> Captured from sunlight using panels.\n- <b>Wind Energy (üí®):</b> Generated from the movement of air.\n- <b>Hydropower (üíß):</b> Created from the flow of moving water.\n- <b>Biomass (üå±):</b> Derived from organic matter like wood or crops.\n- <b>Geothermal Heat (üåã):</b> Sourced from the Earth's internal heat.\n\nRenewable energy is crucial for combating climate change and ensuring a sustainable future."

            "question": "What is climate change?",
            "answer": "üåç Climate change refers to significant, long-term shifts in global temperatures and weather patterns. While Earth's climate has always changed naturally, the current warming trend is primarily caused by human activities since the 1800s.\n\nThe main driver is the emission of greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane, which trap heat in the atmosphere. This leads to:\n- Rising global temperatures.\n- More frequent and intense weather events like hurricanes and droughts.\n- Melting glaciers and rising sea levels, threatening coastal communities."

            "question": "what is solar energy",
            "answer": "‚òÄÔ∏è Solar energy is the most abundant renewable energy source, derived from the sun's radiation. It can be harnessed in two primary ways:\n\n1. <b>Photovoltaic (PV) Panels:</b> These directly convert sunlight into electricity using semiconductor materials.\n2. <b>Solar Thermal Systems:</b> These use mirrors to concentrate sunlight, which heats a fluid to create steam that drives a turbine to generate electricity.\n\nIt is a clean, versatile, and increasingly affordable power source."

        {
            "question": "what is wind energy",
            "answer": "üí® Wind energy harnesses the kinetic energy of moving air by using large turbines. As the wind blows, it spins the blades of the turbine, which is connected to a generator that produces electricity.\n\nWind farms, which are clusters of turbines, are often placed in windy locations like coastal areas, open plains, or hilltops. It is a highly effective and clean energy source when wind conditions are right."
        },
        {
            "question": "what is hydro energy",
            "answer": "üíß Hydropower, or hydroelectric power, is one of the oldest and largest sources of renewable energy. It generates electricity by using the gravitational force of falling or flowing water to spin a turbine connected to a generator.\n\nThis is typically done by building a dam to store water in a reservoir. When electricity is needed, water is released from the reservoir, flowing through the turbine to produce power."
        },
        {
            "question": "what is geothermal energy",
            "answer": "üåã Geothermal energy taps into the heat from the Earth's core. This heat is brought to the surface as steam or hot water, which is then used to drive turbines connected to electricity generators.\n\nIt is a highly reliable and consistent source of power because the Earth's internal heat is always available, regardless of weather conditions on the surface."
        },
        {
            "question": "what is biomass energy",
            "answer": "üå± Biomass energy is generated from organic materials, such as wood, agricultural crops, and waste from forests, yards, or farms. When these materials are burned, the energy released can be used to produce steam for electricity generation.\n\nBiomass can also be chemically converted into liquid biofuels, like ethanol and biodiesel, which can power vehicles."
